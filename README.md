# octi
The octi code base was last touched in 2001. In September 2022, I attempt to bring this code
base back to life and make it runnable again on modern platforms. The efforts here are:
  1. Update the source code from c++98 to c++11
  2. Update the code base from Qt 2.x to Qt 5.x
  
This is more-or-less just a hobby project to revive old code written 21 years ago.
